### What dawn is this?

Within the shelter of his coat pocket, he traced the embroidered initials, ###### between two pressing fingers, upon a fraying handkerchief. 
Noticing here, for the first time, how the edges were lined by a sliver of silk
the first snow of winter gathered upon his eyelashes and dusted nearby branches. 
In a moment of sleepless drifting, the heavy-eyed moon went blind 
unable to find a man distinct from the trees

### Ave Marie

He found her crouched in the basin of a blue porcelain sink, 
Where she drew two small kittens at the bridge of her feet.

She reached for his wrists
and opened his palms to kiss 
the uneven lines of an unfolded tattoo rose.
