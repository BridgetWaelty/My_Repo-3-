### What dawn is this?

Within the shelter of his coat pocket, he traced the embroidered initials, held between two pressing fingers, upon a fraying handkerchief. 
Noticing here, for the first time, how the edges were lined by a sliver of silk
the first snow of winter gathered upon his eyelashes and dusted nearby branches. 
In a moment of sleepless drifting, the heavy-eyed moon went blind 
unable to find a man distinct from the trees

### Ave Marie

He found her crouched in the basin of a blue porcelain sink, 
Where she drew two small kittens at the bridge of her feet.

She reached for his wrists
and opened his palms to kiss 
the uneven lines of an unfolded tattoo rose.

# Prose Undisclosed
## Bridget Waelty

I was told our sun blinked. I was half departed when the sky fluttered in the wide expanse of what seemed like the open mouth of an empty well. We’d run clean out of time, possessing stolen moments from the hands of God and his pupil descended upon us to extinguish the light of thieves.
Now I hold out a single charcoaled matchstick once lit that had been brought to a rising smoke line. The light used to help me find their faces, but without the fire, time moves faster, and I’ve lost the memory of its piercingness. The sound of their voices is all I have to  entertain. I have known them through the sound of their music, how it bounces off every direction in time, ceaselessly moving into a presence that has become my comfort. A mercy I hope to memorize and seal into the deepest cradle of my mind. 

I’ve perched Beneath them, staring at their hazy faces, wondering how they had once meant the world. To me, God refuses to uncover their secrets. To them, I am merely a Shadow. The gap only extends further, and as I speak, the voices fade into silence, taunting my infinite mind with the finitude of memory. One day I’ll forget the sound of this world. I’ll forget the tempered baby and the assured mother. The singing nun and the crying daughter. Such sounds serving as a final token for the damned departed, following us who watch with half-closed eyelids.
